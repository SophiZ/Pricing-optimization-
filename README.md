# Pricing-optimization
## Goal
Pricing optimization is, non surprisingly, another area where data science can provide huge value. <br>
The goal here is to evaluate whether a pricing test running on the site has been successful. <br>
Focusing on user segmentation and providing insights about segments who behave diﬀerently as well as any other insights will be priority.

## Description
Company XYZ sells a software for $39. Since revenue has been ﬂat for some time, the VP of Product has decided to run a test increasing the price. She hopes that this would increase revenue. In the experiment, 66% of the users have seen the old price ($39), while a random sample of 33% users a higher price ($59). <br>
The test has been running for some time and the VP of Product is interested in understanding how it went and whether it would make sense to increase the price for all the users.  <br>
Especially he asked you the following questions:  <br>
1. Should the company sell its software for $39 or $59?  <br>
2. The VP of Product is interested in having a holistic view into user behavior, especially focusing on actionable insights that might increase conversion rate. What are your main ﬁndings looking at the data?  <br>
3. [Bonus] The VP of Product feels that the test has been running for too long and he should have been able to get statistically signiﬁcant results in a shorter time. Do you agree with her intuition? After how many days you would have stopped the test? Please, explain why.
